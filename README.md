# Predicting Song Popularity with Machine Learning

This repository contains my final project for Machine Learning Learning (CSC 371) at Davidson College in the fall of 2020.

This project was open-ended and we were able to choose any research topic. The project required us to perform experiments involving our research problem and write a paper on our findings. A PDF of the paper is contained in this repository.
